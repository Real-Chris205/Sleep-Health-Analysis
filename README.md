# 💤 Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores how lifestyle habits including physical activity, stress levels, and working hours affect sleep duration and quality.  
Using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, I analyzed patterns and correlations to uncover key factors influencing sleep health and overall well-being.



 ## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation  
- Pivot Tables & Charts – For aggregation and visualization  
- Conditional Formatting – For KPIs and performance indicators  



## 📊 Key Metrics & Insights
- Average Sleep Duration: 5.7 hours  
- Sleep Disorder Rate: 41% of respondents  
- Highest Sleep Quality Score: 374 / 1000 which is indicating generally low sleep health
- Average Stress Level: 5.42 on a 10 point scale
- Sales representatives have the lowest average sleep duration among all occupations
- Females show a higher prevalence of sleep disorders compared to males
- Age Trend: Seniors (51+) recorded the longest average sleep hours  

- Possible Causes: Poor lifestyle balance, long working hours, and stress  



## 🧠 Insights Summary
- People aged 51 and above enjoy longer sleep durations, possibly due to lower work-related stress.  
- 41% of respondents reported some form of sleep disorder, highlighting a lifestyle imbalance.  
- Low sleep quality scores suggest that respondents struggle with consistent rest and recovery.  
- Increased physical activity and stress management could significantly improve sleep health outcomes.
- The higher sleep disorder rate among females might be related to hormonal variations, caregiving responsibilities, or multitasking stress.
- Sales representatives lower sleep duration may be a result of irregular working hours, travel schedules, and sales performance pressures

## Recommendation
- Encourage better sleep hygiene: Individuals should aim for at least 7 hours of sleep daily by setting consistent bedtime routines and limiting screen time before bed.
- Implement workplace wellness programs: Since stress levels are moderately high (5.42), organizations can introduce stress management training, breaks, or flexible work hours.
- Targeted support for sales representatives: Employers should consider adjusting workloads or providing health education, as this group reports the lowest average sleep.
- Promote gender-specific health awareness: Female respondents may benefit from sleep health programs tailored to hormonal and lifestyle factors.
- Raise awareness on sleep quality: Since the highest recorded quality score is low (374/1000), campaigns on the impact of stress, caffeine, and screen use on sleep could be helpful.
- Encourage seniors to maintain balance: While seniors sleep more, keeping routines active and social engagement is important to prevent oversleeping or inactivity.
 

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Rebuild this analysis using SQL for deeper analytical insights.  
- Create a Power BI version for interactive visualization.  
- Explore correlations between stress levels, physical activity, and sleep duration statistically.
