# 💤 Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores how lifestyle habits including physical activity, stress levels, and working hours affect sleep duration and quality.  
Using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, I analyzed patterns and correlations to uncover key factors influencing sleep health and overall well-being.



 ## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation  
- Pivot Tables & Charts – For aggregation and visualization  
- Conditional Formatting – For KPIs and performance indicators  



## 📊 Key Metrics & Insights
- Average Sleep Duration: 5.7 hours  
- Sleep Disorder Rate: 41% of respondents  
- Highest Sleep Quality Score: 374 / 1000 which is indicating generally low sleep health
- Average Stress Level: 5.42 on a 10 point scale
- Sales representatives have the lowest average sleep duration among all occupations
- Females show a higher prevalence of sleep disorders compared to males
- Age Trend: Seniors (51+) recorded the longest average sleep hours  

- Possible Causes: Poor lifestyle balance, long working hours, and stress  



## 🧠 Insights Summary
1. People aged 51 and above enjoy longer sleep durations, possibly due to lower work-related stress.  
2. 41% of respondents reported some form of sleep disorder, highlighting a lifestyle imbalance.  
3. Low sleep quality scores suggest that respondents struggle with consistent rest and recovery.  
4. Increased physical activity and stress management could significantly improve sleep health outcomes.
5. The higher sleep disorder rate among females might be related to hormonal variations, caregiving responsibilities, or multitasking stress.
6. Sales representatives lower sleep duration may be a result of irregular working hours, travel schedules, and sales performance pressures
